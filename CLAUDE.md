# CLAUDE.md

This file provides context for Claude Code when working on this project.

## Quick Start

Read the workflow documentation in this order:

1. `docs/how-to-work/agent.md` — How we work together
2. `docs/how-to-work/stack.md` — Technology choices
3. `docs/how-to-work/architecture.md` — System design
4. `docs/how-to-work/conventions.md` — Coding standards
5. `docs/how-to-work/roadmap.md` — Current tasks

## Key Principles

- **Small PRs**: Each PR solves exactly one issue
- **Atomic commits**: Each commit does one thing and passes tests
- **Refactor first**: Preparation commits before feature commits
- **Working software**: Every commit is deployable
- **Simplicity**: YAGNI—don't over-engineer

## Before You Start

1. Read the relevant docs
2. Understand the task from `roadmap.md`
3. Propose a plan before implementing
4. Ask if anything is unclear

## Commit Format

```
type(scope): description

Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore
```

## When Stuck

- Ask questions early
- Surface trade-offs
- Propose alternatives
- Welcome changes to direction
